Use of Tailwind CSS for responsive and attractive styling.

Animated grid reset for a smooth user experience.

State management with useState for tracking game progress.

Logic for matching pairs of cards and advancing levels.

Interactive buttons for resetting the grid and proceeding to the next level.
